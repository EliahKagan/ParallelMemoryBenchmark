# ParallelMemoryBenchmark

This is a simple memory benchmarking tool that makes an array of pseudorandom
numbers and sorts them using an execution policy. The length and policy are
specified by the user.

ParallelMemoryBenchmark is an outgrowth of a program meant to reproduce a
vexing system stability problem. It is not really well-suited to use as a
general-purpose benchmark.

However, it remains interesting as a demonstration of [C++ parallel execution
policies](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag_t)
and as a limited benchmark of them in sorting.

## Building

64-bit builds are recommended.

Release builds (that is, building with optimizations turned on and debug
symbols not emitted) are highly recommended. This is because the timings are of
only slight interest otherwise, and completely irrelevant for comparison
purposes.

Library dependencies are resolved with
[`vcpkg`](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html), which is set up as a
submodule.

**See [`building.md`](building.md) for build instructions.**

## Usage

The most basic usage is to run `pmb` specifying only the length of the
arrayâ€”that is, the number of integers to sort. For example, to sort a billion
integers:

```sh
./pmb 1000000000
```

Output looks like this:

```text
   length:  1000000000 elements (~3814 MiB)
     seed:  1824255722  (generated by the system)
sort mode:  std::execution::par (parallelize)

Allocating/zeroing... Done. (1296 ms)
Generating... Done. (3491 ms)
Hashing... 7c99ae86. (220 ms)
Sorting... Done. (15077 ms)
Rehashing... 7c99ae86, same. (253 ms)
Checking... sorted. (608 ms)

Test completed in about 21.3 seconds (21320 ms).
```

Passing `--help` prints a message that includes a description of all options.
The other currently available options are:

```text
  -l [ --length ] arg   specify how many elements to generate and sort
  -s [ --seed ] arg     custom seed for PRNG (omit to use system entropy)
  -2 [ --twice ]        after sorting, sort again (may test adaptivity)
  -t [ --time ]         display human-readable start time
  -S [ --seq ]          don't try to parallelize
  -P [ --par ]          try to parallelize (default)
  -U [ --par-unseq ]    try to parallelize, may migrate thread and vectorize
```

Of special importance are the options `--seq`, `--par`, and `--par-unseq`, which
specify the policy execution. By default, as shown above, it is as if `--par`
were passed. These options correspond to
[`execution_policy_tag_t`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag_t)
policies.
